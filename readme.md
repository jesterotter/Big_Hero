## General Information

This project is a simple landing page that implements glassmorphism UI.
To make it fun I used Baymax for inspo. A simple webpage showing his skills like a simple calling card.
I want to improve my UI skills to make creative and interesting new projects.
I also wanted to practice making website that are responsive since I find the concept confusing.
